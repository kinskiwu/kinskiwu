## Hi there, I'm Kinski 🙋🏻‍♀️

My journey into software development has been shaped by **curiosity and a love for learning**, leading me through multiple careers. I started as a **translator**, and later took on roles in **visa assessment and IT specialist** at the **Australian Consulate in HK**. These experiences gave me deep insights into **problem-solving, communication, and process optimization**, which now guide how I build **scalable and accessible software solutions** that empower users of all abilities.

**Collaboration** fuels me - I enjoy working with **cross-functional teams** to solve challenges, optimize processes, and bring ideas to life.
