# Hi there, I'm Kinski 🙋🏻‍♀️

<p>I'm a software engineer and co-creator of NextView, an open-source developer tool for monitoring Next.js application performance.👩🏻‍💻
</p>

<br/>

🎭 Fun facts about me:
<p>Outside of software engineering, I enjoy hanging upside down from an aerial apparatus to explore the world from a unique perspective 🤸🏻‍♀️, hiking in Mount Kurama in Kyoto in search of the mystical Tengu 👺, and finding solace in solving puzzles on artificial rock formations 🧗🏻
